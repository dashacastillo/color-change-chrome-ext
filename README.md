# color-change-chrome-ext
light summer 2023 project where i learn how to make a google chrome extension!

# chrome extension function

to change the color palette of the libby browser reader. there are only a limited number of colors available on the desktop version of the app, and i want to change that.

there is no need why this should only be functional with the libby app. i hope to also use it for websites i commonly use (twitter, etc.). the plan is for the code to be generalized for as many websites as possible.

i am aware other such extensions already exist. this is just a fun learning project.
